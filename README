don't use yet, util0.m is not yet final.


# intro

"util" is a library with various commonly used functions.  some are
in other standard libraries (like string.m, lists.m), others are
not.  this library was written because having to write these functions
all the time (which is still faster than copy-pasting) is annoying.

the modules are named with a numerical suffix, a version number.
incompatible version of future libraries (e.g. with changed function
definitions) will have a new number.  this ensures existing programs
using this library will not have to be modified after such an
interface change.

note that there is currently no documentation for the functions
(the code is documentation for now!).  the test program is useful
too.


# install

to install, first make a file "mkconfig" similar to your inferno's
installation mkconfig (symlink/bind it).  now type "mk install" to
compile and install.

when building from within inferno, insert SYSHOST=Inferno and ROOT=
in the mk invocations to override the values in the mkconfig.
